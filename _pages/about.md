I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [Univeristy of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), majoring in both Computer Science and Statistics, minoring in Computational Mathematics. My research interests focus on machine learning, deep learning, and database technologies, with a particular emphasis on developing foundational models and language models.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), working on developing algorithms for bandit foundation models and tabular foundation models, supervised by [Prof. Pascal Poupart](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/).
