I am a fourth-year undergraduate student in [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [Univeristy of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/) pursuing Computer Science and Statistics. My research interest lies in machine learning, deep learning, and database technologies, particularly in developing foundation models, large language models, and information retrieval.

I am currently a Machine Learning Engineer at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), working on developing algorithms for a bandit foundation model.
