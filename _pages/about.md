I am a [MScAC](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) student at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). My research interests focus on Machine learning, Deep learning, AI Explainability and Interpretability. However, I'm open to exploring any interesting problems in the field of Computer Science and Statistics.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student in [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) at the [Univeristy of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), majoring in both Computer Science and Statistics, minoring in Computational Mathematics. I was also a Machine Learning Engineer at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/) and a Undergraduate Research Assistant at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), working on developing algorithms for bandit foundation models and tabular foundation models, supervised by [Prof. Pascal Poupart](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ppoupart/).
